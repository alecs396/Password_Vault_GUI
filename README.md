# Overview

This is a password manager. It allows the user to store their login information in a SQL database.  The vault can only be accesssed by entering a hashed "Vault Key".  User may also use the password generator to create randomized passwords.

I wanted to make this program because I had one of my passwords compromised and I wanted to be more cautious about my security online. I wanted to furthur my experience of SQL Relational databases and felt that this would be a perfect project to help me gain more experience with them. Another concept I wanted to explore more was that of creating a GUI. Most of the code I have done with python simply runs in a terminal.  I stumbled across the TKinter library that allows developers to create a GUI within python.  All in all this has been a fun project for me to work on.
